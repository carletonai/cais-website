  - Main branch: Protected, requires pull request reviews
  - Feature branches: Created for specific features or sections
    - `feature/setup-initial-routes`: Initial page structure and routing
    - `feature/hero-section`: Hero section development
  - Create new feature branches for major components or sections
  - Keep changes focused and atomic

- **Code Quality**:
  - ESLint for code linting
  - Prettier for code formatting
  - Jest for testing
